# 🚚 Predictive Logistics Delay Risk Dashboard

A consulting-style project built using structured problem solving, machine learning, and executive storytelling to identify and mitigate operational delays in logistics.

---

## 🎯 Project Summary

- **Objective**: Predict and reduce delayed deliveries using XGBoost and SHAP.
- **Approach**: SMOTE-balanced classification model, SHAP-based explainability, Tableau dashboards.
- **Outcome**: Reduced predicted delay rate from 40.33% to 34.28%, simulating ~$33K/month in cost savings.
